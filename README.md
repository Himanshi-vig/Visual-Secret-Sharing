# VSS-Encryption
A python implementation of the image secret sharing encryption method described in the Naor-Shamir Visual Cryptography paper, found here: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBFb0053419.pdf

### USAGE
python parsing.py image 

will split the image file into k shares and then combine these shares in the following ways:

Using the computer to convert from white/black subpixels -> white pixel and all black -> black pixel this is result.jpg

'Manually' stacking the shares, this is stacked.jpg
### NOTE
This code is done but the command line interface doesn't really exist yet.

Different values of k can be set on line 88 of parsing.py and the code in that area can be modified to create different files and images.
This implementation only works for k of k implementations not k of n. This is because k of n is a nightmare
